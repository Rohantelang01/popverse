# Learning Notes

Welcome to your `src/learning` notes — a place to keep bite-sized learning items while you build Popverse.

Use this file as a template or index that links to other note files you'll create.

## How to use

- Create one file per topic inside `src/learning/` (e.g., `mongodb-setup.md`, `mdx-migration.md`).
- Keep notes short and actionable — commands, pitfalls, links, and next steps.
- Tag notes with a simple header `Tags:` to help searching.
